# JuicyInfeaux

Browser extension moves all the good stuff to the top of Wikipedia.

## Why

If like me, you go on Wikipedia all the time to find out what the most scandalous fact about a specific celebrity is, you might have been frustrated by how the juicy stuff is buried somewhere near the end of the page.

JuicyInfeaux tries to fix that.

It uses a list of keywords, and if there's a heading that includes one of these keywords, that section gets moved to the beginning of the article, getting you the juicy info you crave, faster.

## Installation

If this actually gets any users, I'll add it to the Chrome webstore.

In the meantime: download the source of this and add it to Chrome in developer mode as an unpacked extension. See [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).

## Thanks
Thanks to Chris from [gomakethings](http://gomakethings.com) for writing the function that makes this whole thing.
